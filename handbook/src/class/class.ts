// It is possible to support both types of indexers...
// It is possible to support both types of indexers, but the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer. This is because when indexing with a number, JavaScript will actually convert that to a string before indexing into an object. That means that indexing with 100 (a number) is the same thing as indexing with "100" (a string), so the two need to be consistent.

// number[] or string[], thatâ€™s really just a shorthand for Array<number> and Array<string>.
